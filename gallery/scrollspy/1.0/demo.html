					<li class="span6"><span class="badge badge-info" style="margin-right:5px;">step 1</span>对DOM结构的要求是，在导航器中设置属性data-href,值为它所对应的内容区域的选择器，例如：
						<br>
						<pre style="width:470px;">&lt;ul class=&quot;nav nav-list&quot; id=&quot;s_index_r_nav&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-href=&quot;#J_Home&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

					<li class="span5"><span class="badge badge-info" style="margin-right:5px;">step 2</span>初始化scrollspy的时候传入5个参数:
						<ol>
							<li>offset: 距离scroll区域顶部的位移,比如如果顶部有fixed的工具条时，可以设置这个值</li>
							<li>navContainer: 导航区块的选择器</li>
							<li>activerSelector: 需要被激活的元素的选择器</li>
							<li>scrollArea: 内容区域的选择器</li>
							<li>navSelector：导航元素的选择器</li>
